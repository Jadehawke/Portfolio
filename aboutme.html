            <h3>Hi there!</h3>
            <h5>I'm Jessica</h5>
            <div id="aboutparagraph">
                <p>I'm currently a student studying computer programming, and for anyone who's internally groaning at the sound of that,
                it has actually turned out to be a lot more fun than I was anticipating. It's definitely better than any other majors
                I've tried, including art and theater (take that, fine arts department!). I work an ordinary job at a call center but
                when I finish school I'm excited to get into the world of web building.</p>
                <p>I live in Utah, which I love for it's various climates. The baking desert valley and lush mountain forests are only 20
                minutes apart! I'll probably live here my whole life (gotta stay close to family!) but I do enjoy a bit of traveling.
                I've been through most of the western US, and spent a lot of time in the greenery of Montana. I've also been overseas to visit
                Germany, Italy, and Switzerland (and France, but only for 1 hour so it hardly counts).
                    I can't wait to do even more traveling!</p>
                <p>In the summer, I love to swim in just about any lake or river, and I frequently head up the mountains for quick and fun
                hikes. I also love the family-friendly versions of most sports, that is to say, volleyball, hockey, soccer, and baseball, with
                fewer rules and sub-par players. I'm no professional, but it's fun to be active!</p>
                <p>Come winter I fill a lot of my time reading, with top favorites being Harry Potter and The House of the Scorpion, and
                writing on creative ideas that are sparked by my books. I like to go out with friends for dinner and a movie, or we can
                stay in for board games. </p>
                <p>I love animals, and I perpetually own cats, though never too many at a time (don't want to tread too close to that line of crazy
                cat lady). I've also had birds, snakes, hamsters, dogs, fish, a chinchilla, and ducks. But cats are the only ones who can find
                their own food and water if I'm slacking, so I just stick with them these days. Once I thought about starting my own zoo,
                but that's a distant idea... unless I can figure out how to get a tiger permit.</p>
                <p>I love my life and I always like to be busy with some project or another. And now you know a little bit about me.
                    I hope you enjoy my website, and maybe some of the other projects I've built.
                </p>
                <p>Have a great day!</p>
